This repository contains all the source code, documentation, and set-up guides necesary to replicate the project. Refer to the PDFs in each section for instructions on how to set up and use each part of the project.


Despite their intense training and incredibly rapid response times, search and rescue teams are often unable to identify locations of surviving victims during disaster scenarios. They rely heavily on local tips and tend to resort to overlaying a grid on the disaster area and searching square by square. Search time could be reduced, and lives saved increased, if there was a better way to determine the location and density of survivors in disaster areas. The goal of this project is to identify survivors using a thermal camera mounted onto a quadcopter and paired with the GPS system to scan large areas and provide feedback of where the most survivors are located. This will allow human users to optimize their search, spending more time saving lives and less time searching empty buildings.
